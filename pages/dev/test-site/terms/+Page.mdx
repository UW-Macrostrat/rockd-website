        Some of our Services allow you to upload, submit, store, send or receive content. You retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in that content. In short, what belongs to you stays yours. 

        When you upload, submit, store, send or receive content to or through our Services that you identify as public, you give Rockd (and those we work with) a worldwide license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works (such as those resulting from translations, adaptations or other changes we make so that your content works better with our Services), communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such content. 

        The rights you grant in this license are for the limited purpose of operating, promoting, and improving our Services, and to develop new ones. This license continues even if you stop using our Services. We offer you ways to access and remove content that you have provided to our Services. Also, in some of our Services, there are terms or settings that narrow the scope of our use of the content submitted in those Services. Make sure you have the necessary rights to grant us this license for any content that you submit to our Services. 

        Our automated systems analyze your content to provide you personally relevant product features, such as customized search results. This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored. 
        
        If you have a Rockd Account, we may display your name, Profile photo, and actions you take on Rockd. We will respect the choices you make to limit sharing or visibility settings in your Rockd Account. For example, you can choose your settings so your checkins are not Publicly displayed.
