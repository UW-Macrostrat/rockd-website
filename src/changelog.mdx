<Version spec="4.0.0" date="July 6, 2022" />

The 4.0 series represents the first major update to the Macrostrat web interface
since 2018. It is the first major version of Macrostrat's web visualization components
that is an evolution of the codebase rather than a complete rewrite.
The 4.0 milestone simplifies, modernizes, and modularizes this application
to allow a more collaborative development process.

Future iterations in the 4.0 series will add functionality such as
stratigraphic columns, paleogeography, geochemical data
holdings, and more.

This update was produced by Macrostrat technical lead [Daven Quinn](https://davenquinn.com)
and research software engineer [Casey Idzikowski](https://caseyidzikowski.com).
