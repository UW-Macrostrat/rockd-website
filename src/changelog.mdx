### User interface improvements

<DocsMedia href="version-4.1.0/settings-panel.png" width={120}>
  The new <em>Settings</em> panel
</DocsMedia>

- Added a new _Settings_ panel to control map display options. The
  _Experiments_ sub-panel allows previews of new features that are still in development.
- Added a **Dark mode** for the entire user interface, including a new map style. This follows
  the browser-level preference by default, but it can be overridden from the _Settings_ panel.

#### Map features and bug fixes

<DocsMedia href="version-4.1.0/basemap-labels.mp4" align="center" width="70%">
  Toggling basemap labels
</DocsMedia>

- Added an option to show and hide text labels on the map (in the _Settings_ panel)
- Added a scale bar
- Moved the _User location_ control to the bottom right corner of the map panel
- Improved the visual quality of hillshades when 3D terrain is enabled
- Decoupled location marker sizing and visual design from map style
- Added an experimental _Map sources_ layer (_not yet fully integrated into the user interface_)

#### Info panel

<DocsMedia href="version-4.1.0/age-refinement-panel.png" />

- Update [xDD](https://xdd.wisc.edu) publications list to use the newer snippets API.
- Added an _Age refinement_ panel to show relative age precision improvement
  using the Macrostrat age model.
- Add buttons in the header to recenter the currently selected map location
  and to copy the location permalink to the clipboard.

#### Line symbols (_experimental_ ðŸ§«)

<DocsMedia href="version-4.1.0/experimental-line-symbols.mp4" align="center">
  Line symbols are critical to the representation of crustal processes on
  geologic maps
</DocsMedia>

In the _Experiments_ panel, we have added a toggle for _Line symbols_, which
enables a new rendering system for fault ticks and fold axes. This is
an exciting advance that greatly increases the legibility and information
density of the geologic map to align with printed products. Although the
graphical style is nearly complete, data inconsistencies block us from
enabling this feature broadly at the moment. Many sources GIS datasets (especially older ones) do not
record consistent orientation of faults and folds that allow symbology to be reconstructed. We must develop a
strategy for correcting these data. As we embark on this process, will begin making this system "live" on a
map-by-map basis.

### Location and filter state saving

- The focused location and info box can be loaded from URL parameters, allowing map locations to be easily shared.
  Optional hash parameters set view orientation, layer, and map filter state. The URL signature is
  `https://macrostrat.org/loc/<lon>/<lat>#<hash>`.
- Correctly save filter states from URL parameters.
- Major simplification of the internal design of the map filter system.

### Internal improvements

- Yarn "Plug-n-Play" for quicker and more repeatable compilation
- Updated key dependencies, including Webpack, Mapbox GL JS, React, and BlueprintJS.
- Numerous updates to [Macrostrat shared web components](https://github.com/UW-Macrostrat/web-components).
- Decoupled interactions in the map view, and moved more components
  to the [`@macrostrat/mapbox-react`](https://npmjs.org/package/@macrostrat/mapbox-react)
  and [`@macrostrat/mapbox-utils`](https://npmjs.org/package/@macrostrat/mapbox-utils) shared libraries.
- Routing improvements in anticipation of adding non-map pages to the application.

<Version spec="4.0.0" date="July 6, 2022" />

The 4.0 series represents the first major update to the Macrostrat web interface
since 2018. It is the first major version of Macrostrat's web visualization
components that is an evolution of the codebase rather than a complete rewrite.
The 4.0 milestone simplifies, modernizes, and modularizes this application to
allow a more collaborative development process.

Future iterations in the 4.0 series will add functionality such as
stratigraphic columns, paleogeography, geochemical data
holdings, and more.

This update was produced by Macrostrat technical lead [Daven Quinn](https://davenquinn.com)
and research software engineer [Casey Idzikowski](https://caseyidzikowski.com).

## User-facing changes

- Add a globe-based map projection and an oblique map
  view with 3D terrain (thanks [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/)!)
- Removed [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) in favor of [Blueprint](https://blueprintjs.com/)
- Make panels simpler and more information-dense
- Store oblique camera positions in hash string
- Numerous bug fixes for filtering map data
- In info panel, expand all sections by default, and improve scrolling through them
  to offset

## Internal changes

- Convert codebase to Typescript from Javascript
- Start converting JSX to hyperscript
- Update React code to use functional components and hooks
- Improve handling of query strings
- Much better state management system and more consistent action handling
