## `[4.0.0]`: Unreleased

The 4.0 series represents the first major update to the Macrostrat frontend in
three years. It is the first major version of the Macrostrat web interface that
is an incremental update, i.e., it is an evolution of the v3 codebase rather
than a complete rewrite. The 4.0 milestone does not add much user-facing
functionality, but it simplifies, modularizes, and modernizes the codebase to
better enable collaborative and iterative development.

Based on this initial release, we will be able to shift to a higher cadence of
releases. Future iterations in the 4.0 series will add functionality such as
stratigraphic columns, paleogeography, a digital globe, geochemical data
holdings, and more.

### User-facing changes
