<Version spec="4.0.0" date="Unreleased" />

The 4.0 series represents the first major update to the Macrostrat web interface
since 2018. It is the first major version of the Macrostrat user interface that
is an evolution of the Macrostrat codebase rather than a complete rewrite.
The 4.0 milestone simplifies, modernizes, and modularizes the codebase
to allow more collaborative development and a simpler development process.

Future iterations in the 4.0 series will add functionality such as
stratigraphic columns, paleogeography, geochemical data
holdings, and more.

This update was spearheaded by Macrostrat technical lead [Daven Quinn](https://davenquinn.com)
and research software engineer [Casey Idzikowski](https://caseyidzikowski.com).
