When zoomed to a localized area, the map can be rotated to 3D by pressing the '3D'
button that appears in the bottom right corner of the map. Drag while right-clicking
the mouse to adjust the view orientation. Click the compass at
the bottom right corner to return to a north-up, overhead view.

### Map filters

The map can be searched and filtered by geologic criteria
including formation names, lithology types, and time intervals.

### Primary literature

Clicking the map reports location-specific data sourced from
geologic maps and stratigraphic columns.

### Geologic layers

Additional layers such as Macrostrat columns,
[PBDB](https://paleobiodb.org) fossil collections, and satellite imagery
can be overlaid on the geologic map.

### Elevation profile
