# Map Editing Interface

Created as part of Macrostrat's mapping pipeline for the CriticalMAAS project to facilitate the consumption and validation of TA1 maps.

Table interface built for quick reconciliation of outside geometries with Macrostrats map representation.

Features:

- Hide and Copy columns
- Standard Filter and Grouping
- Purpose built interfaces for certain columns ( Example: Selection interface for all valid age intervals )
- View of running operations, as well as push and clear functionality
- Virtualized 'infinite' scrolling of table data to keep data downloads web friendly
- Group based auth to prevent outside changes
