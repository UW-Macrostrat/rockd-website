## Codebase

This is an index of the software repositories that are being contributed to as
part of the Macrostrat / UW–Madison CriticalMAAS effort.

### Macrostrat core system

The repositories in Macrostrat's core system will eventually contain the minimum
set of capabilities required to run a functioning instance of Macrostrat. They
will contain the primary deliverables of the CriticalMAAS project and will be
designed to be well-documented and runnable by USGS staff.

- [`UW-Macrostrat/macrostrat`](https://github.com/UW-Macrostrat/macrostrat):
Macrostrat's core system, including its database definitions, control scripts,
and ingestion pipelines. This repository is the primary focus of the
CriticalMAAS project.
- [`UW-Macrostrat/tileserver`](https://github.com/UW-Macrostrat/tileserver):
Server for vector and raster tiles to GIS software
- [`UW-Macrostrat/web`](https://github.com/UW-Macrostrat/web): Macrostrat's main
web interface
- [`UW-Macrostrat/api-v3`](https://github.com/UW-Macrostrat/api-v3`):
Macrostrat's v3 API, which will be the primary API for CriticalMAAS
capabilities

### Reusable libraries

Macrostrat maintains shared libraries that underpin a variety of activities
including CriticalMAAS.

- [`UW-Macrostrat/web-components`](https://github.com/UW-Macrostrat/web-components):
Shared React/Typescript user interface components for rich map-based user
interfaces
- [`UW-Macrostrat/python-libraries`](https://github.com/UW-Macrostrat/python-libraries):
Python libraries used throughout Macrostrat server and control applications,
including tools for database access and data processing.

### Program coordination

Schemas, data interchange libraries, and shared infrastructure for the
CriticalMAAS program.

- [`DARPA-CriticalMAAS/ta1-geopackage`](https://github.com/DARPA-CRITICALMAAS/ta1-geopackage):
a GeoPackage-based data format for validating and storing TA1 output
- [`DARPA-CriticalMAAS/schemas`](https://github.com/DARPA-CRITICALMAAS/schemas):
A repository for schemas and data formats for TA1-3 integrations (_started by
UW–Macrostrat and subsequently contributed to by all TA teams_)
- [`UW-xDD/document-store`](https://github.com/UW-xDD/document-store): A
supplemental store for public/user provided PDFs that provides full-text
access, integrates with xDD APIs.

### Geologic metadata curation

- [`UW-Macrostrat/macrostrat-xdd`](https://github.com/UW-Macrostrat/macrostrat-xdd):
System to synthesize xDD-driven geologic unit descriptions from the scientific
literature (_placeholder for future development_)
- [`UW-Macrostrat/factsheet-generator`](https://github.com/UW-Macrostrat/factsheet-generator):
An LLM-assisted generator for geological "fact sheets" that operates over the
scientific literature (_Bill Xia_; Computer Science)
- [`UW-Macrostrat/unsupervised-kg`](https://github.com/UW-Macrostrat/unsupervised-kg):
Knowledge graph construction to discover new geologic entities in the
scientific literature (_Devesh Sarda_; Computer Science)
- [`UW-Macrostrat/map-metadata-curation`](https://github.com/UW-Macrostrat/map-metadata-curation):
Documentation of efforts to align current archive of maps with **Macrostrat
v2** data standards. Focus on point data, raster image alignment, and
ingestion metadata recovery (_Kate Akin_; Geoscience)

### External integrations

Macrostrat is integrated with systems that provide additional functionality
relevant to CriticalMAAS. Major adjustments to these systems are out-of-scope
for the CriticalMAAS project, but integrations with Macrostrat can provide
useful capabilities to the CriticalMAAS program.

- [**Mapboard topology-manager**](https://github.com/Mapboard/topology-manager):
Topological map manager for PostGIS databases (for editing **TA1** maps and
topologically synthesizing them for Macrostrat output layers)
- [**Corelle**](https://github.com/UW-Macrostrat/corelle): Paleogeographic
rotation system compatible with GPlates
- [**xDD**](https://xdd.wisc.edu/): A system for extracting geologic metadata
from the scientific literature
- [**Mapboard GIS**](https://mapboard-gis.app): An iPad-based GIS for
geologists, with a focus on rapid, intuitive drawing (for **TA1** map editing
if required)
- [**Weaver**](https://github.com/digitalcrust/weaver): Ingestion, curation,
performant filtering, and visualization of massive geological point datasets
(for **TA2** data integration)

## Documentation

Documentation is associated with individual project repositories. Additionally,
some broad documentation is being coordinated across the project towards
building a cohesive, deployable system.

The [`UW-Macrostrat/docs`](https://github.com/UW-Macrostrat/docs) (_placeholder
for future development_) repository will contain broad system documentation and
improve discoverability and usability.

### Map interface examples

The [`v2.macrostrat.org/dev`](https://v2.macrostrat.org/dev) and
[`v2.macrostrat.org/map/dev`](https://v2.macrostrat.org/map/dev) websites
contain examples of Macrostrat's map services for raster, vector, and
point-based data.

### Document extraction

notebook demonstrating the xDD API

### TODO

- [ ] Build [a documentation website](https://v2.macrostrat.org/docs)
(_placeholder for future development_)
- [ ] Document new Macrostrat APIs using the OpenAPI specification in order to
conform to common standards.
- [ ] Documentation websites for
[shared web components](https://github.com/UW-Macrostrat/web-components)
and [Python libraries](https://github.com/UW-Macrostrat/python-libraries)
will be established
