The Macrostrat ingestion process is built to enable the registration, processing and distribution of new maps. Depending
on the registered maps attributes candidate maps that add value to the coalesced interface are added on expert approval.

## Registering a Map for Ingestion

Registration involves uploading all relevant files to a S3 bucket and
then registering these files via API/Command line. After registering a map to the interface you can track its progress
across the ingestion process.

### In Progress

We are currently working to make the registration of a map more available via the web interface. In progress are the
creation of API routes that will allow a user to provide the map files directly via the ingestion interface and have the
automated pipelines that are currently in place translate this map into a new candidate in the Macrostrat system.

## Preprocessing

After a map has been registered it is made known to the internal map pipeline so that it can be prepared for the
harmonization step. This step involves reading the data in the provided format ( Shapefiles, Geopackage, or TA1 output )
and parsing it into its component parts pulling out the points, lines, and polygons.

## Harmonization

This process is what allows Macrostrat to present heterogenous maps in a homogenized map interface. Using the data that
is processed into our points, lines and polygon tables in the previous step we can begin to assign them with our curated
set of geological properties. As you go through this process Macrostrat will continuously ( In progress ) update this maps
tiles and associated metadata APIs. This allows you to continuously improve this map as new information comes in.

## Prioritization

After the harmonization process is deemed complete a expert will review the resulting map. Checking for novelty in the existing
system and quality of ingestion they will decide whether to integrate this map into Macrostrat's Carto dataset that powers
its main interface.

__Note__: A map does not need to be integrated into the Carto dataset for its information/tiles to be exposed via API.
Prioritization is a optional step that maps might not reach.
