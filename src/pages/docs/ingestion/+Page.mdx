# Map Editing Interface

Created as part of Macrostrat's mapping pipeline for the CriticalMAAS project to facilitate the consumption and validation of TA1 maps.

Table interface built for quick reconciliation of outside geometries with Macrostrats map representation.

- [Features](#features)
- [Overview](#process-overview)
- [Starred Column Descriptions](#starred-column-description)
- [Table Commands](#table-commands)

## Features:

- Hide and Copy columns
- Standard Filter and Grouping
- Purpose built interfaces for certain columns ( Example: Selection interface for all valid age intervals )
- View of running operations, as well as push and clear functionality
- Virtualized 'infinite' scrolling of table data to keep data downloads web friendly
- Group based auth to prevent outside changes
- Download the ingested map files to view metadata
- (More incoming)


## Process Overview

### 1. Select the map you wish to process

Log in and find the map that you wish to process on the ingestion page, clicking "Edit" will bring you into the ingestion interface.

### 2. Download the ingested maps metadata

Click on the download link to download the metadata for the ingested map, you will need this to provide more
context about the values shown in the table.

### 3. Use the interface to reconcile the map

Using the table interface the user manipulates the ingested data into standardized fields made easier through the above [features](#features). The table will provide feedback on the level of completion as you work and provide a link to view your processed map. 

The starred columns (â˜…) denote the columns
that are intended to be populated by the non-star columns which are populated via the ingestion process.

#### Starred Column Description

All the columns in addition to these are filled in from the ingested map and can typically be transformed via the
table interface to populate these values. Otherwise, we provide the original .zip file that was ingested to help locate the appropriate README files.

**orig_id**

This column is composed of ids for each polygon. The best way to populate this is to copy and paste the column from the ingestion that most closely resembles a list of discrete values.

**descrip**

This column is the description of the polygon.

**ready**

This column is a **True/False** column used to denote a row as "Ready". These "Ready" rows can then be removed by a column filter.

**name**

Name of the polygon, typically taken from the ingestion.

**strat_name**

Name of the stratigraphy.

**age**

Age of the polygon.

**comments**

Any comments that you would like to make can be entered here.

**t_interval**

**b_interval**

**lith**
