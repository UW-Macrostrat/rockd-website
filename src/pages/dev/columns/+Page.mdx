# Column concept apps

Macrostrat is invested in pushing stratigraphic columns into the digital age.
We have developed a number of applications that explore the potential
user interface design elements around digital columns.

- [Carbon isotopes](/dev/columns/carbon-isotopes)
- [Detrital zircon](/dev/columns/detrital-zircon)
- [Ocean drilling](/dev/columns/ocean-drilling)
- [Age model](/dev/columns/age-model)
