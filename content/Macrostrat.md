Macrostrat is a geological model of the Earth's crust and its stratigraphic
framework. It is a community-driven project that is centered at the University
of Wisconsinâ€“Madison.

The Macrostrat data platform underlies [Rockd](https://rockd.org/), a mobile
application that allows users to explore the geology of the world around them.

Macrostrat's documentation website is part of a push to open up the platform
more fully to contributors in [[Version 2]].

The documentation is open-source, and we encourage contributions. Please
