      <h1 class="title">Getting Started with Rockd</h1>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>Why contribute?</h3>
        Rockd has four goals:
        	<ul>
        	<li>Grow a body of knowledge that can be used to improve our understanding of field geology and Earth materials</li>
        	<li>Augment existing resources, like geological maps, with outcrop-based observations</li>
        	<li>Make it easier and more efficient to learn about geology in the field</li>
        	<li>Engage the social and citizen scientist elements of backyard geology</li>
        	</ul>
         We believe that because mobile devices are location aware and can provide photographic records of geology in the field, anyone can make potentially scientifically valuable observations and contributions to Rockd. The value of your individual contributions will be directly related to the completeness and quality of the data that you provide. This guide will help you make the most of your experience.

        <span class="highlight-question">Checkins</span>

        <span class="highlight-answer">Rockd uses your mobile device's geolocation capability to estimate your location. Once Rockd knows your location, the Macrostrat database is able to provide you with location-specific information. Rockd uses this information to make its "best guess" at what you are actually standing on when you launch the app. The Dashboard displays your latitude-longitude coordinates, compass bearing,  elevation according to the <a href="http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/" target="_blank">SRTM DEM</a>, and  a summary of the most likely rock types, age, and unit name (if any) at your current location. To see your location on a geological map from <a href="https://macrostrat.org/burwell" target="_blank">Macrostrat</a>, click on the "Map" panel. All of this information might be wrong! But it is Rockd's best guess. Adding a new checkin is the best way to provide an update and share knowledge with others.</span>

<span class="highlight-question">INSERT DASHBOARD SCREEN SHOT and adjacent equiavlent MAP SCREEN SHOT</span>

        <span class="highlight-question">Starting a new checkin</span>

        <span class="highlight-answer">To start the checkin process, click on the blue "New Checkin" button at the bottom of the dashboard OR click on anywhere on the map in the Map panel view. Tapping on the map opens a dialogue giving detailed information about the specific point you tapped, including the geological map  description and link to original map source, Macrostrat units matched to that map polygon (where available) and links to published papers in the <a href="https://geodeepdive.org" target="_blank">GeoDeepDive library</a> that mention that specific rock unit. In the map view, clicking on the map gives you the option of checking in to that specific map unit. This is offered as a convenience, and doing so will auto-fill an observation with that map unit selected, as described below.</span>
        
<span class="highlight-question">INSERT MAP CLICK SCREEN SHOT</span>
        
        <span class="highlight-question">Adding new checkin data</span>

        <span class="highlight-answer">Once you start the checkin process by tapping on the dashboard blue "New Checkin" button or by clicking on the map and then selecting the blue new checkin box, you are taken to a blank form. Every checkin has a location description and a rating. Good checkins will also have an overview photo covering the whole of the location.  To take a photo or select one from your camera roll, tap the camera icon.</span>

<span class="highlight-question">INSERT NEW CHECKIN SCREEN SHOT</span>

        <span class="highlight-answer">Below the camera are three important buttons that allow you to edit key information about your checkin. The first allows you to edit the location of the checkin using a map interface, the second allows you to update the date of your checkin, and the thrid allows you to control the privacy setting for that checkin. These are commonly used when making a new checkin when you are not in the field (see below).</span>

       <span class="highlight-question">Adding observations to checkins</span>

        <span class="highlight-answer">Checkins are the start of what can become a detailed, long description of the geological features that are present at that location. Right now, there are 6 different optional elements for each observation:</span>
        <ul>
        <li>Rocks: unit names, map unit, age, rock types (lithologies) and notes</li>
         <li>Fossils: taxonomic names (via <a href="https://paleobiodb.org" target="_blank">Paleobiology Database</a>) and descriptions of fossils</li>
        <li>Minerals: minerals and their forumals (via <a href="http://www.mindat.org" target="_blank">MinDat</a></li>
        <li>Structures: can accommodate any orientation and be used to describe unit contacts, faults/folds, etc.</li>
        <li>Sublocation: an optional additional coordinate that provides the specific location of that observation for the checkin</li>
        <li>Photo: an additional photo that is specific to the observation</li>
        </ul>
<span class="highlight-question">INSERT NEW OBSERVATION SCREEN SHOT</span>

     <span class="highlight-question">Syncing checkins</span>

        <span class="highlight-answer">Rockd works best when you have a mobile connection, but not all locations have good wireless connections. Good checkins with lots of observations and photos can also be data-intensive. To make Rockd more flexible with its internet demands, you have the option to sync your checkin immediately (when there is a connection) or to save the data for submission to the server later. You may choose to sync later, when you reach a WiFi spot, to save data on your mobile plan or to make the process faster.</span>

<h3>Using Rockd at home</h3>

        <span class="highlight-question">Making checkins for past field stops.</span>

        <span class="highlight-answer">The mobile version of Rockd is designed to be used in the field. However, it is possible add data to existing checkins and to make new checkins for locations that you are not currently visiting. This makes it possible, for example, to add data from past field trips. To add a new checkin for a remote location, you should start the process by locating the spot in the map panel. Pinch to zoom and drag to pan and navigate to the correct location. You may find it helpful to turn off the bedrock polygon layer and "Search for place", both accessed from the map menu button. Once you find the location of your checkin, tap on the map to start the checkin process described above. Be sure to spend time precisely locating your checkin! Good geolocation of checkins is one of the most important aspects of Rockd data. </span>

        <span class="highlight-question">Updating a checkin date.</span>
 		<span class="highlight-answer">By default, Rockd checkins assign your current date to each new checkin. However, the date can be changed by tapping on the date in the checkin submission panel. You should always update the date to be indicative of the last observation you made at that location. This will help users know how much time has passed and whether they might expect to see changes in exposure conditions if they decide to visit that location.</span>
            
<h3>Gaining Rockd XP</h3>
        <span class="highlight-question">Quantifying your geological experience</span>

 		<span class="highlight-answer">"The best geologist is the one who's seen the most rocks," or so they say! Rockd gives you the fun, and sometimes informative, capacity to automatically and quantitatively track your progress through the geological record. You earn Experience Points (XP) for every checkin and observation you make. You also gain XP for adding more observations and data to existing checkins. The more data, the more points!</span>
 		<ul>
        <li>Checkin: 100 XP each</li>
        <li>Photos: 100 XP each</li>
        <li>Rocks (including stratigraphic names, map units, and lithologies): 20 XP for first in each observation, 5 XP for each additional</li>
        <li>Structures: 20 XP for first in each observation, 5 XP for each additional</li>
        </ul>

    <span class="highlight-question">Tracking your experience in geological time</span>

 		<span class="highlight-answer">Because Rockd knows a lot about rock units in advance, whenever you tag them or supply your own more precise age information, you will increment a personal counter for the relevant time interval(s) (periods in the Phanerozoic, eras in the Proterozoic, and the Archean). Each checkin determines your timescale points. If your checkin has two observations for two different rock units, one Cambrian and one Ordovician in age, then you will receive +1 in both periods. If you checkin to a single rock unit that spans the Cambrian-Ordovician, then you will receive +0.5 for both. If you know the age more precisely than Rockd, you can enter an age as an observation. If your age is more precise, that will be the basis for your GeoTime XP. Earn bonus Rockd XP by seeing more time intervals and improving your experience of each!</span>
