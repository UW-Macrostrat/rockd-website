# web-v3

Macrostrat's map interface is the intersection of stratigraphic, bedrock, paleoenvironment, and paleontology data in the modern world.

Currently the application is bundled using webpackv5; however, in the near future we will be transitioning to use [NextJs](https://nextjs.org/) to take advantage of server-side rendering, simplified page routing, and already managed bundling.

## Getting started

Install dependencies with `npm install`

To begin the development server run `npm run dev`. The server will be hosted to `localhost:3000` by defualt.
