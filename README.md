# Macrostrat's map interface

Macrostrat's map interface is the intersection of stratigraphic, bedrock, paleoenvironment, and paleontology data in the modern world.

Currently the application is bundled using webpackv5; however, in the near future we will be transitioning to use [NextJs](https://nextjs.org/) to take advantage of server-side rendering, simplified page routing, and already managed bundling.

## Getting started

This package requires relatively new features of package managers for multi-package workspaces.
Make sure you have NPM version 7 or higher. This can be installed with `npm install -g npm@7`.
This package should work with Yarn, but we haven't yet tested it.

Install dependencies with `npm bootstrap` (which is simply an alias to `npm install --workspaces && npm install`).

To begin the development server run `npm run dev`. The server will be hosted to `localhost:3000` by defualt.

## Running Locally

Spins up a instance of the website for development on the same node image used for prod. 

```bash
docker run -it -p 3010:3000 -v $(pwd):/app -w /app node:20 git config --global --add safe.directory /app && yarn run dev
```

## Building Production Locally

This is mainly here for reference, the actual prod image is built via Github CI.

```bash
docker build -t macrostrat:latest --build-arg PUBLIC_URL=/map/ --build-arg MAPBOX_API_TOKEN=<> .
```

### Running built image

If for some reason you want to run the prod image locally you can do it like so.

```bash
docker run -d -p 8089:80 macrostrat:latest
```
